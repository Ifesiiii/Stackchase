              Our Story.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Stackchase was founded on a simple belief — that Africa can build its own technology stack, from messaging to mission-critical systems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Born out of deep engineering experience, Stackchase designs and builds platforms that power communication, collaboration, and business resilience at scale. Our flagship product, Ration, delivers messaging, meeting and collaboration for organizations that demand reliability, compliance, and control — all hosted on our own bare-metal infrastructure.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We are reimagining what platforms can be — developing our own standards for performance, security, and interoperability. By combining deep systems engineering with original thinking, Stackchase is setting a new benchmark for how technology is designed, delivered, and experienced across regions that have long depended on external platforms.
            </p>

            <p>
              From Nigeria to the world, Stackchase is creating technologies built with care, engineered for scale, and driven by purpose.
